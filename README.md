# RCRacers
A collection of my runtime configuration files

##Installation:
  To install all files, they must usually be copied to the home directory
  of the current user on the machine. On unix systems, this is referred to by
  '~'. Running 'make' in a terminal will copy all RC files to ~/.
  If not all of these files are desired, please do a manual 
  'cp file1 [file2 file3 ...] ~/' in your terminal.
